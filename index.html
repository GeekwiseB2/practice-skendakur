        <h3>I wanted to start my own website/blog and had hired a web designer, but I wasn't satisfied with the idea of always needing to go through a "middle man". I heard about Geekwise Academy from my hairstylist. I had told her that I was studying Javascript on my own without any coding or programming background. It was a struggle. I pretty quickly signed up for my first course here after speaking with her and I'm so glad that I did. Now I have the opportunity to not only create my own website, but begin a career. I have already learned so much and become a part of a community that I hope to continue growing in while building my career.</h3>
