        <h3>My relationship with coding/programming began almost incidentally. I was shifting career fields and was looking into starting my own website/blog. I had contacted a web designer, but I wasn't satisfied with the idea of always needing to go through a "middle man". I decided that I wanted to learn more about this field and once I started I realized that I really enjoyed it. I began to think that this could be a career opportunity for me- that I could learn skills that would bring creativity, purpose, and independence to my life. I was struggling through the process of indepedently trying to learn Javascript when I found out about Bitwise/Geekwise from my hairstylist. I pretty quickly signed up for my first course  after speaking with her and I'm so glad that I did. The mentorship and community have been great. I have already learned so much and hope to continue growing while building my career. I'm excited to see where I can go and what I can create with these tools I'm acquiring!</h3>
